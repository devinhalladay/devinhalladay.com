<p>Welcome! My name is Devin Halladay. I'm a web designer, graphic designer, and writer.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>I craft beautiful and honest visual solutions. I sincerely care about the stories with which I work and I have an ambition towards the finest of execution.</strong></p>

<p>I value craftsmanship, curation, and careful research. I try to make those characteristics present in <i>every</i> project I work on. Building beautiful products does not just mean making something visually appealing &mdash; it means taking every pixel into consideration and giving an equal amount of care to every minute detail.</p>

<p>Design is my passion.</p>
