Welcome! My name is Devin Halladay. I'm a web designer, graphic designer, and writer.

<p class="lead"><strong>I deliver beautiful and honest visual solutions. I sincerely care about the stories with which I work and I have an ambition towards the finest of execution.</strong></p>

I value craftsmanship, curation, and careful research. I try to make those characteristics present in *every* project I work on. Building beautiful products does not just mean making something visually appealing &mdash; it means taking every pixel into consideration and giving an equal amount of care to every minute detail.

Design is my passion.
