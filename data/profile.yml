about:
  - title: "The Basics"
    content:
      - "Hi! I’m Devin, a multidisciplinary designer, writer, and sculptor currently based in Baltimore, MD. I primarily work as a product and editorial designer, designing and simplifying complex systems at every scale."
      - "I work closely with clients to achieve elegant, performant design solutions while maintaining a constant critical and conceptual lens on the work I’m making and its implications. I thrive on complex systems thinking and love nothing more than defining well-conceived product mechanics."
  - title: 'Methodology'
    content:
      - "My focus is on creating layered and expressive systems across traditional, current, and future media — from identity systems, to books, to user interfaces."
      - "To that end I develop design systems in book and editorial design, typography, brand identity, and web and product design, through rigorous conceptual development, content strategy, and research."
      - "I see every project as an opportunity to question the state, understanding, and values of design: each piece is a constant interplay of conceptual experimentation and applied knowledge."
      - "My primary motive as a practicing artist and designer is to give coherence to complex systems. Sometimes this means designing the invisible, breaking with the expected, and on occasion embracing established values with sharp criticality."
