      - "Hi! I’m Devin, a multidisciplinary designer, writer, and sculptor currently based in Baltimore, MD. I primarily work as a product and editorial designer, designing and simplifying complex systems at every scale."
      - "I work closely with clients to achieve elegant, performant design solutions while maintaining a constant critical and conceptual lens on the work I’m making and its implications. I thrive on complex systems thinking and love nothing more than defining well-conceived product mechanics."
