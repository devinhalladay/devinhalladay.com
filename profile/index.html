      <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>

      <p>I love to craft user-friendly interfaces and build beautiful websites by using simple design and modern web-standards. Bringing content to the user without distracting him and using beautiful typography and color schemes to achieve that is my passion and my hobby.</p>
      <p>After being self-taught for about 3 years I am now working and learning at Grey Germany. I'm also working part-time as an UX and visual designer at Lookbook.</p>
