      <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
      <p>My name is Devin Halladay.<br>I'm a graphic designer, writer, and humanist.</p>
      <hr class="hr--long">
      <p class="text--lead">I craft honest visual solutions. I sincerely care about the stories with which I work and I have an ambition toward the finest of execution.</p>
      <hr class="hr--long">
      <p>I value craftsmanship, curation, and careful research. I try to make those characteristics present in every project I work on. Building beautiful and functional designs does not just mean making something visually appealing â€” it means taking every pixel into consideration and giving an equal amount of care to every minute detail.</p>
      <p>Design is my passion.</p>
