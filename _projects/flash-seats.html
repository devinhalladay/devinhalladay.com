        Flash Seats is an innovative online ticketing system that eliminates paper tickets, streamlines event entry, allows buying and selling of tickets, and makes it easy for one user to transfer tickets to another.
      </p>

      <p class="sans">
        This project was, for the most part, entirely conceptual and probably won't be used. Its main purpose was to try to envision the future of the Flash Seats brand.

      <h3>Original Experimentation</h3>
      <p>I originally began with some rough sketches, and quickly decided that it would be best to stay true to the original Flash Seats brand with a lightning bolt for the primary mark.</p>
      <p>After doing some research on the Flash Seats brand and ticketing system, I realized how central fans are to the core of the brand. With this in mind, I decided that the brand's new visual identity also needed to focus on the fans.</p>

      <p>After playing around with the above concept, I realized I was going about this the wrong way. I took a step back, looked at the project as a whole, and decided to start over.</p>
      <p>I was focusing too much on aesthetics. The brand needed to be funtional, minimal, and get out of the fan's way. That's where the final concept comes into play.</p>
