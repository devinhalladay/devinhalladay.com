        Oddball is a family-owned-and-run lifestyle and fashion company (and by family, I mean part of my family: my eldest brother and my dad). While they design the products, I have been responsible for the branding, multiple websites, and brand strategy.
      </p>

      <p class="sans">
        To date I've worked on a ton of promotional materials, brand collateral, web design and development, and identity design. The brand is still taking shape and continuously evolving, but the future of the brand looks promising.
      </p>

      <p class="sans">
        The eCommerce site isn't quite ready, but it should be launching in early November 2014. Keep an eye on <a href="http://wearoddball.com">wearoddball.com</a>.

      <h3>The Landing Page</h3>
      <p>I created a landing page for the launch to collect emails. This was written in Ruby on Rails and Sass, using PostgreSQL for the database and Heroku for hosting. The page collects an email and lets the user through to a new page, allowing them to refer friends for exclusive rewards.</p>

      <p>Upon entering their email and submitting the form, the user is taken to this page. Fancy. When a user refers a friend, the timeline-like reward bar progresses further toward the reward.</p>
