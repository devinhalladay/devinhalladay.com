    "abstract": "Since the emergence of consciousness, the real has been inaccessible to the conscious, as described by the likes of Lacan, Nietzsche, Deleuze, Marx, Benjamin, and many others. The history of civilization is not the story of man's continued and enhanced comprehension of the world, but of man's accelerating removal from it. The emergent social phenomena of technical optics — from perspective lattices, to magic lanterns, to camera obscuras, to augmented reality glasses — represent a single dialectical phenomenon that has gone unchanged, and has simply shifted in orientation and intensity over the course of human history: the illusion. This essay attempts to trace a few major developments in the history of technical optics and illusion since the 17th century and describe in what ways these developments altered the materiality of human consciousness, experience, and knowledge."

    "abstract": "All structures of power exist in and are executed by the most mundane and quotidian parts of our social reality. These structures of power, despite their looming presence, are merely composed of the everyday: people, telephone numbers, histories, assemblages, networks, websites, connections, buildings, and text. Power, expressed through this social text, is an assemblage of micro-articulations, expressed by signifiers that are themselves the articulations of a network of differences — what Derrida called différance."

    "abstract": "Hegel may consider Stoicism a stage of human consciousness, but to believe this is to consider nihilism a stage of human consciousness. Stoicism wears a mask of affirmation but its true face reveals a deep and intractable ressentiment. The Stoic mindset is a violent, passive nihilism uprooted from its affirmative soil and turned by some sickly botany into a pharmakon. This passive nihilism—defined by Nietzsche as a decline and recession of the power of the spirit— leads the Stoics to ends that denigrate their own humanity, defeating their espoused tenets of acceptance and endurance."

    "abstract": "By reading Plato’s dialectical structure formally, this essay will uncover a new ontology composed of the series of political regimes, social allegiances, and transcendental thralldoms Plato problematizes throughout the Republic. Using that ontology as its foundation, this essay will then reveal Plato’s hidden objective: to construct an apparatus of sociopolitical forces designed to correct and guard against transcendental and immanent disorder in the polis, as a direct response to the slow decline of Ancient Greece."
