<h2 class="hug">You're this deep in already — may as well keep reading</h2>
<p>I’m a multi-disciplinary designer working across all media to understand and implement efficient interactive systems — whether those systems be products, brand identities, books, or spaces. I graduated <em>magna cum laude</em>, with honors, from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2019 with my BFA in Graphic Design and Critical Theory.</p>
<p>My design practice combines heavy doses of critical and design theory with practical considerations, to interrogate the politics expressed through the acts and artifacts of design.</p>
<p>My rigorous, research-based approach to creative work has led me to develop expertise many areas of design practice, particularly in the disciplines of graphic and product design. Previously, I have been a product designer for Palantir Technologies, Quora, 64 Robots, and Friends of the Web.</p>
<p>
 In addition to product design, I have experience in front-end development, branding, book and editorial design, public space design, 3D modeling and animation, and new media experiences — to name a few.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I am a partner, not an arbiter. There is no truth. I believe that the best design is made through close collaboration and constant experimentation, iteration, and feedback.</p>
<p>My design practice pairs systematic nuance with conceptual rigor in order to achieve elegant, performant design solutions that provoke and question established values.</p>
<ol class="process-list">
<img src="/assets/images/profile/research.svg" alt="Research Icon">
<li><strong>Research</strong> — The fun part. I embed myself as deeply as possible in the subject matter in question in order to fully understand its problem space and ground truths. Then I question those ground truths ruthlessly in search of alternative futures.</li>
<img src="/assets/images/profile/strategy.svg" alt="Strategy">
<li><strong>Strategy</strong> — I work collaboratively with stakeholders to develop design and project strategy based on my research and the stakeholders' needs. This ensures that we're all on the same page and can track toward a common goal by using a common language.</li>
<img src="/assets/images/profile/design.svg" alt="Design">
<li><strong>Design &amp; Iterate</strong> — I experiment liberally and explore the full breadth of possible and future-possible solutions by mapping the problem space in detail. My prior research and strategy are essential to this stage, as they improve the accuracy of the final artifact.</li>
<img src="/assets/images/profile/delivery.svg" alt="Delivery">
<li><strong>Delivery</strong> — The final products (be they instructions, files, principles, poems, playlists, typefaces, questions, more questions, <em>always</em> more questions) are delivered comprehensively and with detailed documentation of process and implementation.</li>
<img src="/assets/images/profile/afterwards.svg" alt="Afterwards">
<li><strong>Afterward</strong> — I maintain long-term relationships with stakeholders to ensure the design process doesn't end in a singular Design Object but rather a living artifact that can be iterated on into the future.</li>
