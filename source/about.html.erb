<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary designer working across all media to understand, design, and maintain systems at every scale. I work with clients internationally. Previously, I was a product designer at <a href="http://palantir.com">Palantir</a>, <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a>, and <a href="http://friendsoftheweb.com">Friend of the Web</a>.</p>
<p>I am concerned first and foremost with the ethics and politics of design, and believe that aesthetics are ideology made concrete. As such, I believe that every designed form contributes in some way to the political reality, and I work hard to ensure that my contributions are positive.</p>
