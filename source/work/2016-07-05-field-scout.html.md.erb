    <p>Inspired by lifestyle brands like Ugmonk, I wanted to create a toy geared toward other designers with aesthetic taste similar to mine. The result, after research, a few bad ideas, and constant iteration, is Field Scout.</p>
    <p>This was my first time working with wood, designing a toy, and designing packaging, so it was a very helpful learning experience. Taking the project from initial idea sketches, moodboards, and word associations to final product and packaging was an extremely rewarding process.</p>
    <p>The most important part of my process was considering the packaging as a part of the toyâ€”unboxing the toy should be just as much fun as playing with it. With that in mind, I decided to make the packaging into an airplane hangar, a literal and symbolic home for the airplane. Copywriting was also of great importance in this project, pulling the design together with strong typography and a good backstory.</p>
