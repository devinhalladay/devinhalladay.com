    <p>Around the world, many people face surveillance, internet blocks and firewalls, sanctions, and fear of imprisonment from their governments. This abuse of the internet, an inherently free and open space for ideas to form and change, strips people of their freedoms of speech and expression and prevents simple joys like watching movies or catching up with old friends no Facebook.</p>

    <p>Many people in these countries use VPNs to bypass government blocks in websites that enable free communication and access to outside journalism. However, VPNs can also help anonymize users and keep them safe from hacking, surveillance, logging, and identity theft.</p>

    <p>In Trump’s America, I think it is absolutely necessary that all Americans who have any wish to oppose the policies and actions of Trump and his cabinet have easy access to VPN technology so they can remain safe and free.</p>

    <p>However, all consumer VPN apps and services I have come across are confusing, use lingo and technology terms that most people will not understand, have horrible interfaces, and make the barrier to entry for potential VPN users too high. I think this needs to change. </p>

    <p>So I designed Faraday, an accessible VPN app for iOS and macOS, for my Design for UX final project. My hope is that I’ll find a proper developer and really make this app. so every step of the way I have designed this app with the technology limitations in mind and possibly programatic solutions in view.</p>
