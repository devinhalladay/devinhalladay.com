      <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>

      <p>My name is Devin Halladay.<br>I'm a graphic designer, writer, and humanist.</p>

      <hr class="hr--long">

      <p class="text--lead">I create honest solutions to complex problems. I sincerely care about the stories with which I work and have an ambition toward the finest of execution.</p>

      <hr class="hr--long">

      <p>I value craftsmanship, curation, and careful research. I've put those principles to the test over the last few years and the results have been wonderful. I have five years of experience working with agencies, startups, and other companies large and small. The future is wide open, and I'm looking forward to creating something amazing with some amazing people.</p>
