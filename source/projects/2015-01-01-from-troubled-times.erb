    <h3>The Book</h3>
    <p>I'm also self-publishing a book called <em>From Troubled Times</em>. It will include my poetry, prose, short stories, and analytical piecesâ€”all of which deal in some way with depression, emotional disconnect, heartbreak, melancholy, and the disconnected life of modern individuals. It will be a limited run of 3 books: one for myself, one for my best friend, and one for the teacher who most influenced me during high school.</p>
    <p>Below are some spreads of the book.</p>
