  <h2>A Better Way to Set Alarms</h2>
  <p>If you're anything like me you've experienced this annoying problem: you set about 10 alarms to wake up in the morning and have a list of over 100 alarms in Clock.app on your phone set at 5â€“25 minute intervals. You wake up and forget to turn off some of them and they go off in a meeting making you look stupid, or you set the wrong ones and wake up late.</p>
  <p>Alarms shouldn't be that hard to create an maintain, and iOS doesn't do a good enough job. So I created a hypothetical solution: <strong>Alarm Contexts</strong>.</p>
  <p>An Alarm Context is, quite simply, a single alarm that repeats itself at a regular interval during a specified duration. It simplifies the 10 alarms I set every morning into a single entry, allowing me to turn off a single alarm instead of turning off 10. Additionally, a user can snooze the current alarm iteration in the Context and the next alarm will go off after the specified interval passes, ensuring you never miss that important meeting again.</p>
