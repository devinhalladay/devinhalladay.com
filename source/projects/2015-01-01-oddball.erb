    <h3>The Landing Page</h3>
    <p>I created a landing page for the launch to collect emails. This was written in Ruby on Rails and Sass, using PostgreSQL for the database and Heroku for hosting. The page collects an email and lets the user through to a new page, allowing them to refer friends for exclusive rewards.</p>

    <p>Upon entering their email and submitting the form, the user is taken to this page. Fancy. When a user refers a friend, the timeline-like reward bar progresses further toward the reward.</p>
