title: "On Change"
---
Keep a record of everything in your lifeâ€”the big, the small, the bad, the good. One day ten years from now, five years from now, hell, even one year from now, you'll be able to look back at the way things were and see that all the shit you went through to get to this point was entirely worth it. You will learn from your mistakes, you will see growth. You will surprise yourself. You will realize that not everything happens for a reason but that everything you did, said, and felt has led you to this little apotheosis. You will feel triumphant for one glorious moment; but that moment will be fleeting. You will change again, then look back, undefeated; and then you will face change and defeat again, and again, and again. But it will all be worth it.
