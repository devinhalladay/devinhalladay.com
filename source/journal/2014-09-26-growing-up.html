<hr class="hr--short">

I'm afraid of what's going to happen when I'm older, when I'm out of high school, when I'm out in the real world. I'm afraid of not being the smartest person in the room anymore, as I so often am in high school. I'm afraid of stagnation, of conforming, of being the same as everyone else.

I've always tried to grow up faster than I needed to. Now I'm nearly an adult and I wish I would've enjoyed my childhood more. My life has been such a drag for years because I have felt older, more mature, and wiser than those around me—but now everything is happening so quickly and it's a bit of a shock. As it turns out, even though I thought I was older than my age (if that makes any sense) nothing could have prepared me for these last, fleeting moments of my life as a "kid", for the lack of a better word.

The more I think about this, though, the more I come to realize that I've been stagnating, stuck in a rut, for years now. Yeah, I've learned a lot, I've grown up, started businesses, started a career early in life, but I haven't allowed myself to grow as a person as much as I should have. I haven't allowed myself to change—only to dig deeper in that same rut. Maybe growing up will be a new chance for me to get out of this rut. Maybe. I guess the only way to find out is to take the leap.

I'll see you on the other side.
