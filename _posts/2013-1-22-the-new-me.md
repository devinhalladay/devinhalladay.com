My website has been reborn. My branding has been reborn. I have been reborn. *This is the new me*.

So here I am, finally publishing a post on a personal website that I'm proud to call my own. What prompted this change? *Lots of things*.

One month ago today I made some huge changes to my life. I am now working hard to balance school, design, family and friends in order to improve my quality of life.

I know this is a very short blog post, but I'm in a last minute rush to push my new site (this one) live by 4:00 PM.

This site and its new design exemplifies my personality, my minimalist beliefs, and, most importantly, my love for design. I will be sharing reviews, interviews, and hastily-developed personal thoughts every week.

Info about the site:

+ Typeset in FF Tisa Web Pro and Proxima Nova, served by TypeKit.
+ Published using Jekyll and GitHub.
+ Handmade in three days using SublimeText 2 and Photoshop CS6.

I will be posting a followup to this post in the next day or two explaining the "new me" and thanking all of the people that have supported me thus far in my still-budding career as a designer & developer.
