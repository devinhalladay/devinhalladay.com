As designers, I'm sure we can reach a general consensus that when web design, we design for the viewer. We use color theory, white space typography, and countless other elements of design (some of which we are not even aware that we are using) in order to convey a message or a feeling to the viewer.
But what is the secret to great design that successfully conveys those feelings or messages to the user?

The secret is ***soul***.

You're probably wondering, *"What the hell does that even mean? Is this guy crazy?"* Well I can assure you that I am crazy, but that is beside the point.
When designing, you need to design not just with the user in mind, but with *yourself* in mind. It's important to remember that great design is not only concise beautiful, and creative; it is soulful. Let's dive deeper into the *soul* part of this and see what happens when we come out on the other side.

The soul is a beautiful thing. This may sound crazy, but your soul is what makes thoughts and feelings *real*. I know that we have all seen a design, at one time or another, that just hits us straight in the soul. For me, that design is anything by [Jon Contino](http://joncontino.com/). If you haven't heard of Jon (what am I saying, of course you've heard of him!) then go check out some of his work and watch some videos about him. Jon pours his soul into everything he designs, and successfully conveys the desired message almost every time. *We all need to be a little more like Jon.* We need to pour our soul into everything we design. But I digress.

***I am a designer of souls.***

I pour my heart and soul into every design I make. Sure, sometimes I make mistakes and the design doesn't turn out the way it's supposed to — but that's okay. By using your soul to design rather than your brain, you can create a connection with the viewer that is stronger than your silly color theory and white space.

So, in everything you design from this point onward, I want you to give your design a ***soul***.

I have been working and writing all day, so this article may not be as eloquently written as you might have hoped — but I truly hope that you can take something away from this. I hope that you have learned that great design is not just pixels or ink, but rather the *soul* that makes the design *special* and *real*.

**I am a designer of souls.** ***Are you?***
