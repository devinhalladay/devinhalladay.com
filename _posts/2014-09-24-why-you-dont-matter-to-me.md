I'll let you in on a little secret: you probably don't matter to me. You see, I'm an introvert and I'm a nerd. I've been alienated by you for most of my life for the latter (it's okay, though, because I know you're just intimidated by my intelligence). I have more things going on in my mind at one time than you can even imagine. Chances are, you're not interesting to me. It's nothing personal, though—it's just that I've seen you before a million times in every other person I've seen in my life. You may be "unique" in the pre-school acceptance sense, but unless there is something remarkable about you, you're the same as everyone else to me: you simply blend in.

I have more important things to worry about than you. I have notebooks full of ideas waiting impatiently to be executed. I have a section of my thoughts dedicated to dissecting the universe (a futile venture), a section dedicated to my business, a section dedicated to literature, a section dedicated to my own writing and design. You're not relevant to me.You're just another person: unremarkable. As far as I can tell you have no purpose, or you've yet to discover one. That's okay, but it won't work for me. If you can prove me wrong, I invite you to. I have a hunger for knowledge, for wisdom, and if you can impart some to me I will be forever grateful. But if you have nothing important to say, I don't want to hear it. I don't care.

Now you might be thinking, Hey this guy needs an ego check! You're probably right. My greatest flaw is my scarce humility. I acknowledge that. And I'm okay with it. If you don't like it, then you probably can't relate to me and therefore: you don't matter to me.

We're nothing alike. I'm a designer, a writer, a developer (well, I'm learning to be a developer). I spend my life hovering over notebooks, writing, reading, working at my computer, taking in information faster than you could ever process. Life to me is something to be understood, something that can be perfected and mastered through practice and research. I have a system for everything. I have plans, I have well-thought-out methods for processing the things I come into contact with every day. You, however, are messy: you don't fit into my plans. I'm not saying that I'm not messy (I am), but I know how to handle my own messiness. I don't know you. I have no system for taking in the information you give out, and that bothers me.

Where I find beauty and amazement, you find nothing. You seem shallow to me. What you present to me through your words is what I think of you. Oh, you have a pointless thought about a pointless thing? Okay, I've processed that bit of information and I've decided it's not relevant to me. This happens in an instant. And you don't like that: you wish I'd listen more, you wish I'd participate more. But until you present me with something more interesting, you shouldn't expect me to interact with you on a very high level of thought. I'm more likely to be thinking through a difficult problem or puzzle, authoring poetry in my head, or taking a moment to assess my life than I am to involve myself with your unfamiliar thoughts.

Let's get one thing straight again so you don't start getting angry: I have nothing against you personally. I'm sure you're a great person, I'm sure you have hopes and dreams just like I do, I'm sure you appreciate some of the same things as I—but that's not enough for me to interact with you. I empathize with you, but that's not enough for me. You're still unremarkable. You're average. You have nothing new to offer my mind and soul, which are hungry for knowledge, for wisdom. If I don't think I can gain anything—knowledge, wisdom, or empathy—from interacting with you, I just won't interact with you. I'll avoid you because, in the words of Bukowski:
> People empty me. I have to get away to refill.

I want to understand everything this life has to offer, but if there's nothing new about you for me to understand, you probably don't matter to me.
