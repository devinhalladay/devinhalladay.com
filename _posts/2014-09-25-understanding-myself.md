<span class="text--lead">I've taken some time to think about an article I wrote yesterday (it has since been removed). If you saw that article, I want to make a few things more clear and try to explain myself a bit more. If you didn't see the article, you should be thankful—it was terrible. So, here it goes.</span>

<hr class="hr--short">

In my last column, I wrote some pretty harsh stuff, and it was extremely conceited. I regret that. You see, I'm an egotist, and I can be extremely obnoxious at times. I've only just started to accept this fact in the last month or two. That's a problem, and I need to fix it. In part, I think this is a defense mechanism. I've worked hard to learn and soak up a lot of knowledge in my life. It bothers me that not everyone else has this desire to learn about everything, but that doesn't give me the right to be a jerk to them. So I put out a front because I don't want to be seen as someone who is ignorant or who doesn't value knowledge—when in fact my actions do just the opposite. This is a problem that I need to fix, but old habits are hard to break. It's going to take some work, but I'll get past this eventually.

I also wrote about empathy in my last column. I realize now my last column did not show any empathy toward anyone. I don't know what other people are going through, I don't know their current situations, or their intelligence, or what they are thinking until I talk to them. And even when I talk to them, I don't know the full picture. So who the hell am I to judge others? I'm just another guy. We're all in this together, and I need to become more of a team player.

Other people make me uncomfortable. My life is comprised entirely of systems that I understand, and I have plans for handling the various things that I encounter every day. Other people are messy (just as I am) in that I have no system for understanding them. I don't know the ins and outs of how they work, because each person is different. There is no way I can know everything about even a single person, let alone all people, and that's extremely frightening to me. However, that's no excuse for me to be a jerk to other people. They might all be in the same boat as I, thinking the same thing as I am—except their thoughts are directed toward me.

<hr class="hr--short">

I need to work on some things. I need to think about the way I act, and I need to alter it. I need to stop worrying about understanding everyone else for a little while and try to understand how *I* work, so that I can set aside my personal thoughts to focus on others.

It's going to be a challenge for me. A very difficult one. I don't like change, and I sure as hell don't like changing myself—but it's something that needs to be done. I'll work hard to change my old habits of conceit and egotism because that's not who I really am, and I don't want to become that kind of person. I'm a pretty nice guy, I swear; but the front I put out doesn't even give others a chance to see my good side.

My lack of humility is my greatest flaw, and it's something that has been holding me back in life for a while now. I'm sorry for being a conceited jerk. I'll fix it.
