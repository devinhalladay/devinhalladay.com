description: 'I have long been fascinated by the beauty, simplicity, and effectiveness of French editorial design.<br><br>To work on my typography skills as well as venture into a new medium, I decided to begin designing a series of posters. I design a few every month, and I plan to begin selling them in 18x24 prints in early 2014.'

        <strong>Those Who Wander</strong>: This poster began with me experimenting with blackletter typography. I had been reading Tolkien's <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> at the time and this quote form the novel really resonated with me. I decided to take my passion for lettering to the next level and created this poster.
