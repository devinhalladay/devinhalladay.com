Hello, Human*
=================

Welcome to my humble slice of the Internet.

## A Few Rules

1. Stay out of the fucking `_posts` directory. **All that shit is &copy; Copyright 2014 "My Fucking Soul"**.
2. Credit me if you use any of my shit.
3. Have some fucking fun and get inspired by my shitty website.

\* *Or alien. If you're some extraterrestrial being, ping me. I've got some seriously cosmic shit to ask you.*
