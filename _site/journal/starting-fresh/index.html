          <article><p>Last week, my Windows 7 <span class="caps">PC</span> of three years crashed. I lost three entire years worth of design files, school work, and photos. I lost music, programs, and emails. I lost everything — all my hard work and memories (both good and bad). At first, I was utterly devastated. But after I had exhausted all possible routes of recovering my files, I came to realize that stating of with a clean slate would do me more good than&nbsp;bad.</p>

<p>I called my dad and told him that, after two years of whining about wanting a Mac, it was finally time to fulfill that dream. Two days later, we ordered my 13-Inch MacBooK Pro off the Apple website and requested store pickup. Keep in mind that this was only 45 minutes before the Apple Store closed. The drive from our house to the Apple Store is <em>usually</em> about 45 minutes — we made it there in 35 (shh, don&#8217;t tell). After arriving at the Apple Store, the manager let me know that my computer won&#8217;t be ready for pickup for a few hours, but they close in five minutes. My dad, thinking quickly,&nbsp;interjected:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s just buy another one in the store, and then I&#8217;ll &#8216;pick up&#8217; and return the other computer tomorrow on my way home from&nbsp;work!</p></blockquote>

<p>Thanks dad, that was wicked cool! So I walked out of the store that day a proud owner of a brand now MacBook Pro. I also had a fresh start — a clean slate — to be more productive and work harder than I ever had&nbsp;before.</p>

<p>This experience opened open many doors for me. I learned a few valuable lessons, was introduced to the copywriter for a cool new startup called <a href="http://widdle.it">Widdle</a>, was able to share <a href="https://theguild.co">The Guild</a> with a few people, and, most importantly, learned how to work hard for the things that I want or need. My new Mac has drastically changed the way I work, read, and browse. The vast spectrum of apps that are available for the Mac is breathtaking. From design apps to development apps; from reading apps to writing apps; from games to focus tools, and everything in between, these tools have increased my productivity and creativity&nbsp;tenfold.</p>

<p>But I digress. Starting fresh without any files or programs has increased my productivity and has allowed me to see my work more clearly. With the $100 App Store gift card that I received for free with my Mac, I purchased tons of useful apps — but only the apps I <em>need</em>. Nothing less, nothing more. This is a great way to start a new chapter in my life. I&#8217;m finally done seeing the thousands of errors thrown by Windows&#8217; <span class="caps">CMD</span> whenever I tried running a Ruby Gem. I&#8217;m finally through struggling to run Photoshop and Sublime Text 3 at&nbsp;once.</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;m finally free from the shackles of Windows</em>.</p>

<p><strong>My hard work is gone</strong>, but I have a totally clean slate to create better work. I have a fresh&nbsp;start.</p>

<p><strong>And it feels <em>great</em>.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to a new computer, I just launched the finished redesign of my website, which you are currently viewing. <a href="http://twitter.com/devinhalladay">What do you think?</a> You can read a bit more about this site in my about page under the &#8220;Colophon&#8221; section, or you can wait a few days until I blog about its&nbsp;creation.</p>
