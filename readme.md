This is my home online. It's always in transition.

Currently, as it has been for the past two years, my site is running on Middleman. I like itâ€”it allows full customization of every aspect of the system through plugins and helper methods as well as vast configuration potential.

## Getting started
If, for whatever reason, you want to load up my site in a local server, follow these steps. If you have issues, it's on you to figure them out because I don't offer support for other people on this repo.

1. Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2. If you're using rbenv, make sure you have Ruby v3.0.0 installed, and the process should go smoothly. If you're using RVM, then switch to rbenv ASAP and make your life easier.
3. Run `bundle install` to install gem requirements.
4. Run `bundle exec middleman server`
5. Open up localhost:4567 in your browser and you should be good to go.
